		/**
		 * @brief This class provides the features necessary to implement  simple non blocking games.
		 *
		 * The games that can be created out of NonBlockingGame are
		 * based on a simple board grid of at most 1024 cells (e.g.,
		 * 32x32, or any combinations less than 1024 cells). Each
		 * cell has a background color, and a colored symbol.
		 *
		 * This class is used by having another class derive
		 * from it and implement the two functions: initialize()
		 * and GameLoop(). initialize() is called exactly
		 * once, on the first frame of the game. It is used to
		 * make first time initializations of the game state
		 * (such as setting the board in its initial position,
		 * for instance in chess). However, GameLoop() is called
		 * at every frame of the game. The game starts when the
		 * function start() is called on the object you
		 * created.
		 *
		 * For this reason the simplest game that can run is created
		 * by:
		 *
		 * \code{.cpp}
		 * #include <NonBlockingGame.h>
		 * using namespace bridges::game;
		 * struct my_game : public NonBlockingGame {
		 *   my_game() : NonBlockingGame (1, "myuserid",  "myapikey") {}
		 *   virtual void initialize() override { }
		 *   virtual void GameLoop() override { }
		 * };
		 *
		 * int main () {
		 *   my_game g;
		 *   g.start();
		 * }
		 * \endcode
		 *
		 * This game does not do anything, but it is the
		 * minimal code that will run a game. Note that the
		 * constructor of my_game passes 3 parameters to the
		 * constructor of NonBlockingGame(). These three
		 * parameters are the classic parameters that the
		 * constructor of bridges::Bridges takes (e.g.,
		 * assignmentID, username, apikey).
		 *
		 * To change the board, two functions are
		 * used. setBGColor() change the background color of a
		 * particular cell. It takes three parameters, the
		 * first two identify the cell of the board to change,
		 * and the last one is a color from a color palette
		 * provided by NamedColor. drawSymbol() takes four
		 * parameters, the first two identify the cell of the
		 * board to change, the third is a symbol from a
		 * symbol palette provided by NamedSymbol, the fourth
		 * is the color that symbol shold be drawn in and
		 * provided by NamedColor.
		 *
		 * For instance, a very simple initialize() could look like:
		 * \code{.cpp}
		 * virtual void initialize() override {
		 *   setBGColor(0, 0, NamedColor.lightsalmon);
		 *   drawSymbol(0, 0, NamedSymbol.sword, NamedColor.blue);
		 * }
		 * \endcode
		 *
		 * Note that the size of the board is set by default
		 * at 10x10 and that drawing on a cell that does not
		 * exist will lead to an error. One can specify a
		 * gameboard of a different size by passing additional
		 * parameters to the NonBlockingGame
		 * constructor. However, the game can not be more than
		 * 1024 cells in total, so a 15x15 board is possible,
		 * a 32x32 board is the largest square board possible,
		 * and a rectangular 64x16 rectangular board is also
		 * possible. But a 100x20 board would be 2000 cells
		 * and is not possible. For instance a board of 16
		 * rows and 64 columns can be created defining the
		 * my_game constructor as:
		 *
		 * \code{.cpp}
		 *   my_game() : NonBlockingGame (1, "myuserid",  "myapikey", 16, 64) {}
		 * \endcode
		 *
		 * The bridges game engine will call the GameLoop()
		 * function at each frame of the game. You can write
		 * this function to modify the state of the game board
		 * using setBGColor() and drawSymbol(). For instance,
		 * the following GameLoop() will color the board
		 * randomly one cell at a time.
		 *
		 * \code{.cpp}
		 * virtual void gameLoop() override {
		 *   setBGColor(rand()%10, rand()%10, NamedColor.lightsalmon);
		 * }
		 * \endcode
		 *
		 * The gameLoop can also probe the state of some keys
		 * of the keyboard using functions keyUp(), keyLeft(),
		 * keyDown(), keyRight(), keyW(), keyA(), keyS(),
		 * keyD(), keySpace(), and keyQ(). These functions
		 * return a boolean that indicate whether the key is
		 * pressed at that frame or not. For instance, the
		 * following code will only color the board randomly
		 * when the up arrow is pressed.
		 *
		 * \code{.cpp}
		 * virtual void gameLoop() override {
		 *   if (keyUp())
		 *     setBGColor(rand()%10, rand()%10, NamedColor.lightsalmon);
		 * }
		 * \endcode
