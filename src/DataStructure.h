 *
 * \section overview_sec Overview
 *  The Bridging Real-world Infrastructure Designed to Goal-align, Engage, and
 *  Stimulate (BRIDGES) project is directed at improving the retention of sophomore
 *  students in Computer Science by (1) introducing real-world datasets (Facebook,
 *  Twitter, etc) into course projects involving computer science data structures,
 *  and (2) facilitating peer mentoring of sophomores by senior CS students in
 *  shared lab experiences that involve the use of the BRIDGES infrastructure in
 *  software development.
 *  \section br_client BRIDGES Client Design
 *  BRIDGES client side design loosely follows the basic data structure elements
 *  implemented and described in ``A Practical Introduction to Data Structures and
 *  Algorithm Analysis" by C.A. Shaffer (http://people.cs.vt.edu/shaffer/Book/).
 *  These elements are augmented to contain visual properties that are controlled
 *  by the user to customize the visual representation of the constructed data structure.
 *  Once a a data structure is ready to be visualized, related BRIDGES server calls are
 *  made to send a reprsentation of the data structure to BRIDGES server.
 *  \section br_server BRIDGES Server Design.
 *  BRIDGES server implements a combination of technologies (MongoDB, Node,
 *  d3JS(visualization) to receive a data structure representation for visualization.
 *  These are largely transparent to the user and involves the user being directed to a
 *  web page for viewing the data structure. Attention has been paid to provide
 *  meaningful error messages to the user in case problems are encountered in the process.
 *  \section api_sec API Descriptions.
 *  See the accompanying pages for detailed description of the BRIDGES classes
 *  \subsection sponsor_sec Sponsorship/Funding.
 *  BRIDGES is an NSF TUES Project.
